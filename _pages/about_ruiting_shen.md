Ruiting Shen is a master’s student in the [A3SR](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/ms-applied-statistics-social-science-research) program at NYU. Her research interests, in general, focus on applying statistical and machine learning models to psychological and educational latent variable modeling. This includes, but is not limited to, incorporating behavioral data&mdash;[such as test process and user clickstream data](/projects/process_data)&mdash;into traditional IRT models to improve the accuracy of ability and item parameter estimations and interpretations; statistical applications of large language models (LLMs); and model evaluation tool development. In practice, she also enjoys learning programming languages and working on data processing, management, and statistical consulting. Outside of research, she loves trying good food and coffee, swimming, researching fashion trends, and playing chess.

**Ruiting will be applying to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2026 admission!**
