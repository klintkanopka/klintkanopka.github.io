The course provides students with the software skills and theoretical knowledge
required to apply latent construct measurement techniques in R. The course assumes
a working knowledge of R, linear regression, and basic probability. Continuous
and categorical latent variables, dimensionality reduction, clustering,
finite mixture, and diagnostic classification models are covered. The course focuses
on cross-sectional applications of measurement techniques, with examples
drawn from education, psychology, and social science.
