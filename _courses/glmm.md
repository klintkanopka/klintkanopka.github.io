A second year course in advanced statistical techniques that covers useful quantitative tools in health & policy research. Assuming a strong foundation in regression & the general linear model, this course focuses on data analysis that utilizes models for categorical, discrete or limited outcomes that are commonly seen in health & policy studies. Examples include health status, number of clinic visits, etc. In this course students will also learn the principles of likelihood based
inference, which will assist them in some of the more advanced statistics courses. Extensions include multilevel models and generalized additive models.
